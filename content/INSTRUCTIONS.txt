## Important Notes

1. **File Names**: Keep the exact file names as specified above. The system looks for these specific names.

2. **YAML Frontmatter**: The section between `---` at the start of some files is called YAML frontmatter and must be formatted exactly as shown.

3. **Markdown Support**: All content files support standard markdown formatting including:
   - Headers (# ## ###)
   - Lists (- or 1. 2. 3.)
   - Bold (**text**)
   - Italic (*text*)
   - Links ([text](url))

4. **Images**: Place any images you want to use in the `public` directory and reference them with absolute paths starting with '/'.

5. **Real-time Updates**: The system automatically reflects changes to content files, so you can edit and see changes immediately in development mode.

For more detailed configuration options and advanced features, refer to the project's README.md file.
